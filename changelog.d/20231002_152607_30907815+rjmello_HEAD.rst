New Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Endpoint admins can now define a Globus authentication policy directly in an
  endpoint's configuration or by using the ``--auth-policy`` flag when running
  the ``globus-compute-endpoint configure`` command.

  Users are evaluated against the policy when submitting tasks, retrieving endpoint
  information, etc. For more information regarding Globus authentication policies,
  visit https://docs.globus.org/api/auth/developer-guide/#authentication-policies.
  Please note that we do not currently support HA policies.
